# FNF: Bobby's Dumbass Pack of Tweaks

just some dumbass scripts i made or edited (mostly)

make sure to CLONE the repo to get the exact folder name! as an optional dependency, you'll need to have the correct folder name for it to reload the mod list!

uhh [gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/mods/622155)

## changes

- a-bot now uses `AdjustColorShader` if nene uses a `DropShadowShader`, so a-bot doesn't bug out anymore

- `nene-tankmen`'s a-bot instance takes HSBC values from nene. same goes for `otis-speaker`

- `spookyMansion` stage now has `AdjustColorShader` used on characters and the background

- `mallXmasErect` uses new shader parameters (credits to denoohay, it was a minimal change really)

- character select screen now has a hueshift overlay on the camera (i just thought it was cool)

- results screen background is blue instead of yellow (only for pico) to match pico's backing card

- `schoolErect` and `schoolPico` stage logic has been merged into one stage (but duplicated since i was too lazy to edit week 6 pico mix metadata)

- `phillyTrainErect` stage now plays the week 3 pico mix cutscene if the player AND opponent are pico (it would only check for pico as the player)

- added daddy dearest (week 1 and 5) losing icons (by blantados)

- the strumline background is now below the health bar and ratings (BETOPIA CODED THIS (not me), her script for this was too cool i decided to add it in)

## credits

- bobbyDX - being an absolute idiot and coding almost every script here
- betopia - strumline background repositioning module
